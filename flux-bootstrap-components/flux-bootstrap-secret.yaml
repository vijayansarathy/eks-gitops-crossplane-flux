# Kubernetes Secret that provides the SSH keys neeed for Flux to connect to a GitHub repository.
# Easy way to create this Secret is to use the "flux create secret git" CLI command.
# Then, using Bitnami's Kubeseal CLI, we can create a SealedSecret resource from this Secret and use the former in GitOps workflows.
# Once we have a SealedSecret, this Secret that it was generated from is no longer needed.
