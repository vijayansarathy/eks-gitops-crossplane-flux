# Crossplane AWS Provider configuration to make the provider Pod run under IRSA instead of using the credentials of an IAM user
# Deploying this will result in the creation of a service account under whose identify the Crossplane Controller will run.
# The annotation specified here will be added to the service account so that it gets associated with the IAM role specified in the annotation.
# However, trust relationship of the IAM role should reference the service account in order for IRSA to work and this is where the chicken-and-egg problem raises.
# The service account under which the Provider Pod runs is not known apriori and therefore this approach is not well-suited for automation because 
# The name of the service account matches the pattern "crossplane-provider-aws-XXX" where the "XXX" suffix is unique for every Crossplane AWS Provider version.
# One viable alternative is to use a wild-card entry for the service account such as "crossplane-provider-aws-*"
# Refer to the documentation here: https://github.com/crossplane/provider-aws/blob/master/AUTHENTICATION.md#steps
