# Previously, the AWS credentials of an IAM user were made available to the Crossplane AWS Provider using a Kubernetes Secret
# The Kubernetes Secret was deployed using a SealedSecret resource which then gets unsealed into a Secret by the SealedSecrets Controller.
# This is no longer needed after making the Crossplane AWS Provider run under IRSA.
