#
# In addition to reconciling the state of the cluster where the GitOps Toolkit is installed, Flux V2 is capable of reconciling the state of a remote cluster too.
# When a Kustomization is configured with a 'kubeconfig' field, objects will be applied, health-checked, pruned, and deleted for the remote cluster specified in that KubeConfig.
# The Secret defined in the 'kubeConfig.SecretRef' must exist in the same namespace as the Kustomization and provides the relevant KubeConfig data.
# On every reconciliation, the KubeConfig bytes will be loaded from the 'value' or 'value.yaml' key of the secret’s data, and the secret can thus be regularly updated if cluster-access-tokens have to rotate due to expiration.
# For reconciling the state of a remote cluster, you will have to create a ServiceAccount in the remote cluster with appropriate RBAC permissions.
# Every ServiceAccount is associated with an authentication token found in the corresponding Secret within the same namespace.
# The KubeConfig generated for the remote cluster should provide the ServiceAccount's authentication token.
# Then, a Secret is created in the same namespace where the Kustomization resource is deployed on the cluster where Flux is installed.
